# Smart band for smart climate control
This project consists of the software driving a NodeMCU-based activity tracker, known as a "smart band".

The software is written in Lua for the NodeMCU firmware platform.
We use a custom-built edition of the NodeMCU firmware, available at <http://github.com/spatil47/nodemcu-firmware>.
This project is designed to operate on the floating-point edition of the NodeMCU firmware.
